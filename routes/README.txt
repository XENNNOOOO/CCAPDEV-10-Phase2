*** create a separate js file for every route ***

disregard the current route files (adminRoutes, customerRoutes, restaurantRoutes) (trash folder)
you can copy the routes in them but make sure to paste them in another file
and name them accordingly.

Naming Format:
rc_ for customerRoutes
ra_ for adminRoutes
rr_ for restaurantRoutes

Examples:
    rc_getAccount
    ra_getReports
    rr_createAccount
