*** create a separate js file for every route ***

disregard the current route files (adminRoutes, customerRoutes, restaurantRoutes)
you can copy the routes in them but make sure to paste them in another file
and name them accordingly.

Naming Format:
c_ for customerRoutes
a_ for adminRoutes
r_ for restaurantRoutes

Examples:
    c_getAccount
    a_getReports
    r_createAccount
